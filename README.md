# Diabetes-Prediction-API
Developed an API to handle predictions for a Random Forest classifier model that predicts diabetes types based on health data. Implemented RESTful endpoints (Swagger) for making predictions, evaluating model performance, and generating visualizations. Optimized model accuracy through feature engineering and pipeline integration.
